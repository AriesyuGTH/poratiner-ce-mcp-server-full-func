# Project Brief: Portainer CE MCP Server

## Core Requirement

To develop an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables LLM (Large Language Model) agents to interact with Portainer, a container management tool.

## Main Goal

To supplement the existing MCP server functionalities by implementing the remaining tools as defined in the Portainer CE API Specification (currently targeting version 2.27.4 via SwaggerHub: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/portainer/portainer-ce/2.27.4#/, or ideally, raw YAML/JSON content provided by the user). The server should provide comprehensive coverage of the Portainer API, allowing LLM agents to manage various aspects of Portainer.
