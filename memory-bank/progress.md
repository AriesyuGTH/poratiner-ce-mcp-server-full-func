# Progress: Portainer CE MCP Server

## Current Status & What Works

-   **Memory Bank Initialized**:
    -   `projectbrief.md`: Defines core project requirements and goals.
    -   `productContext.md`: Details why the project exists, problems solved, and operational flow.
    -   `activeContext.md`: Tracks current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and key decisions (including testing/commit workflow).
    -   `systemPatterns.md`: Documents the system architecture, key components, request flow, and design patterns based on `repomix-output.xml`.
    -   `techContext.md`: Outlines technologies used, development setup, dependencies, and tool usage patterns based on `repomix-output.xml`.
-   **MCP Server Foundation**:
    -   The basic structure of the MCP server is in place (`src/main.ts`), using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
    -   It can register tools and handle `ListToolsRequest` and `CallToolRequest`.
    -   Communication is via `StdioServerTransport`.
-   **Portainer API Integration**:
    -   An API client (`src/api/portainer.ts`) using `axios` is implemented to interact with the Portainer API.
    -   Configuration is managed via environment variables.
-   **Existing Tools**:
    -   A suite of MCP tools for Portainer management is already implemented and registered in `src/main.ts`, covering functionalities for:
        -   Container Management (fetch, create, start, delete, logs, update resources, prune)
        -   Image Management (fetch, delete build cache, delete unused)
        -   Network Management (fetch)
        -   Service Management (fetch, logs, inspect, update/restart)
    -   These are mapped from constants in `src/constants/index.ts` to functions in `src/api/portainer.ts`.

## Current Status & What Works (Continued)

-   **`authenticateUser` Tool (Auth `POST /auth`)**:
    -   Successfully implemented (constants, types, API function, main.ts registration and handling).
    -   Successfully tested using `portainer-ce-develop` server configuration (pointing to local Deno script initially, then to compiled `src.exe`) and user-provided credentials. Returned a valid JWT.
-   **Development Environment & Workflow**:
    -   Added `portainer-ce-develop` entry to `cline_mcp_settings.json`.
    -   Resolved Deno server startup/dependency issues with `npm install`.
    -   Established workflow for testing local Deno server and compiled executable.
    -   Successfully compiled the project to `src.exe` using `deno compile --allow-read --allow-env --allow-net --env-file=.env src/main.ts`.
    -   Committed changes for `authenticateUser` tool to Git (`feat: add authenticateUser tool`).
    -   Pushed commit `f17ff90` to remote repository.
-   **MCP Server Configuration for Compilation**:
    -   Updated `cline_mcp_settings.json` to temporarily rename the command path for `portainer-ce-develop` during compilation to avoid file lock errors, then restored it to point to the new `src.exe`.

## Current Status & What Works (Continued)

-   **`list_users` Tool (Users `GET /api/users`)**:
    -   Successfully implemented (constants, types, API function, main.ts registration and handling).
    -   Type signature for `listUsers` in `src/api/portainer.ts` refined to use imported `User[]`.
    -   Successfully recompiled the project to include the `list_users` tool in `src.exe`.
    -   Successfully tested using `portainer-ce-develop` server configuration (pointing to the new `src.exe`). Returned a list of users.

## Current Status & What Works (Continued)

-   **`list_stacks` Tool (Stacks `GET /api/stacks`)**:
    -   Successfully implemented (constants, types, API function, main.ts registration and handling).
    -   Successfully recompiled the project to include the `list_stacks` tool in `src.exe`.
    -   Successfully tested using `portainer-ce-develop` server configuration. Returned a list of stacks.

## What's Left to Build / Next Steps

**User Management** functionality (specifically `create_user`) is currently paused.

Continuing with **Stacks (Stack Management)**.
The next tool to implement is `inspect_stack` (corresponds to `GET /api/stacks/{id}`).

**Implementation Plan for `inspect_stack`:**
1.  **Define Tool Constant**: Add `InspectStack` to `Tools` in `src/constants/index.ts`.
2.  **Add Type Definitions**: The response type `Stack` is already defined. The input will be a stack ID (number).
3.  **Implement API Function**: Create `inspectStack(id: number): Promise<Stack>` in `src/api/portainer.ts`.
4.  **Register Tool**: Add tool definition for `inspect_stack` in `src/main.ts`.
5.  **Handle Tool Call**: Add a case for `Tools.InspectStack` in `src/main.ts`.
6.  **Testing**: Test the `inspect_stack` tool.
7.  **Compilation**: Compile the server.
8.  **Git Commit & Push**: Commit and push changes.

**Overall Plan for Stacks (Stack Management) - after `inspect_stack`**:
*   Continue implementing tools for creating, updating, and deleting stacks.

**Broader Implementation Plan (Post-Stacks, if User Management remains paused):**
1.  **Backup/Restore**
2.  **LDAP Configuration**
3.  **Review and Enhance Container Management Tools**

## Known Issues & Blockers (Historically)

-   **Large File Reading / API Specification Access**:
    -   Initial attempts to read `api-swagger.yaml` (original reference) and `swagger-api-docs/api-swagger 5.yaml` (user-provided alternative) via `read_file` tool failed due to size limitations.
    -   Attempts to use SwaggerHub URLs (versions 2.27.5 and 2.27.4) via `browser_action` tool encountered difficulties in scrolling/exporting the full specification due to UI interaction limitations.
    -   **Resolution**: User provided the content of `swagger-api-docs/api-swagger-essential.yaml` directly, which is now the primary reference for API definitions.
    -   User provided the content of a reduced-size `repomix-output.xml` directly, enabling its analysis for existing code structure.

## Evolution of Project Decisions & Workflow

-   **Memory Bank First**: Established the practice of creating/updating Memory Bank core files at the beginning of a work session or significant task.
-   **Structured Workflow**: Adopted a clear workflow: define requirements -> understand architecture & tech -> implement -> test -> commit.
-   **Testing and Commits**: User emphasized the requirement for thorough testing of each feature and committing changes upon success. This is now part of the documented workflow in `activeContext.md` and `techContext.md`.
-   **Adaptability to Information Sources**: Shifted from relying on local large files (which failed to load) to attempting to use SwaggerHub URLs for API documentation. Due to browser interaction limitations, now requesting raw API spec content directly from the user. Using direct content for architectural overview (`repomix-output.xml`) was successful.
