# Progress: Portainer CE MCP Server

## Current Status & What Works

-   **Memory Bank Initialized**:
    -   `projectbrief.md`: Defines core project requirements and goals.
    -   `productContext.md`: Details why the project exists, problems solved, and operational flow.
    -   `activeContext.md`: Tracks current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and key decisions (including testing/commit workflow).
    -   `systemPatterns.md`: Documents the system architecture, key components, request flow, and design patterns based on `repomix-output.xml`.
    -   `techContext.md`: Outlines technologies used, development setup, dependencies, and tool usage patterns based on `repomix-output.xml`.
-   **MCP Server Foundation**:
    -   The basic structure of the MCP server is in place (`src/main.ts`), using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
    -   It can register tools and handle `ListToolsRequest` and `CallToolRequest`.
    -   Communication is via `StdioServerTransport`.
-   **Portainer API Integration**:
    -   An API client (`src/api/portainer.ts`) using `axios` is implemented to interact with the Portainer API.
    -   Configuration is managed via environment variables.
-   **Existing Tools**:
    -   A suite of MCP tools for Portainer management is already implemented and registered in `src/main.ts`, covering functionalities for:
        -   Container Management (fetch, create, start, delete, logs, update resources, prune)
        -   Image Management (fetch, delete build cache, delete unused)
        -   Network Management (fetch)
        -   Service Management (fetch, logs, inspect, update/restart)
    -   These are mapped from constants in `src/constants/index.ts` to functions in `src/api/portainer.ts`.

## Current Status & What Works (Continued)

-   **`authenticateUser` Tool (Auth `POST /auth`)**:
    -   Successfully implemented (constants, types, API function, main.ts registration and handling).
    -   Successfully tested using `portainer-ce-develop` server configuration and user-provided credentials. Returned a valid JWT.
-   **Development Environment for Local Deno Server**:
    -   Added `portainer-ce-develop` entry to `cline_mcp_settings.json` to enable `use_mcp_tool` for the local Deno server.
    -   Resolved initial Deno server startup issues by running `npm install`.
    -   Ensured correct `.env` (specifically `PORTAINER_BASE_URL`) is used by restarting the Deno server.

## What's Left to Build / Next Steps

The next priority area is **Users (User Management)**. The general plan for implementing tools in this area is:

1.  **Analyze User-Related Endpoints in Swagger**:
    *   `GET /users` (List users)
    *   `POST /users` (Create user)
    *   `GET /users/{id}` (Inspect user)
    *   `PUT /users/{id}` (Update user)
    *   `DELETE /users/{id}` (Delete user)
    *   `PUT /users/{id}/passwd` (Update user password)
    *   `GET /users/{id}/tokens` (Get user API keys)
    *   `POST /users/{id}/tokens` (Create user API key)
    *   `DELETE /users/{id}/tokens/{keyID}` (Delete user API key)
    *   `GET /users/admin/check` (Check admin existence)
    *   `POST /users/admin/init` (Initialize admin)
    *   `GET /users/me` (Get current user)
2.  **Implement Tools Sequentially**: For each endpoint or logical group of endpoints:
    *   Define tool constant(s) in `src/constants/index.ts`.
    *   Add TypeScript type definitions for payloads and responses in `src/types/index.ts` (e.g., `UserCreatePayload`, `UserResponse`, `UserUpdatePayload`, `UserPasswordUpdatePayload`, `UserAPIKeyCreatePayload`, `APIKeyResponse`).
    *   Implement the API interaction function(s) in `src/api/portainer.ts`.
    *   Register the new tool(s) with description and input/output schemas in `src/main.ts`.
    *   Add `case`(s) to the `CallToolRequestSchema` handler in `src/main.ts`.
    *   Test thoroughly using `portainer-ce-develop`.
    *   Commit changes.
3.  **Compilation (Optional, as per user request)**: After a significant set of User Management tools are implemented and tested, consider compiling the server using `deno compile --allow-read --allow-env --allow-net src/main.ts --output src.exe` (or similar, based on user's refined command).

**Broader Implementation Plan (Post-Users):**
1.  **Stacks (Stack Management)**
2.  **Backup/Restore**
3.  **LDAP Configuration**
4.  **Review and Enhance Container Management Tools**

## Known Issues & Blockers (Historically)

-   **Large File Reading / API Specification Access**:
    -   Initial attempts to read `api-swagger.yaml` (original reference) and `swagger-api-docs/api-swagger 5.yaml` (user-provided alternative) via `read_file` tool failed due to size limitations.
    -   Attempts to use SwaggerHub URLs (versions 2.27.5 and 2.27.4) via `browser_action` tool encountered difficulties in scrolling/exporting the full specification due to UI interaction limitations.
    -   **Resolution**: User provided the content of `swagger-api-docs/api-swagger-essential.yaml` directly, which is now the primary reference for API definitions.
    -   User provided the content of a reduced-size `repomix-output.xml` directly, enabling its analysis for existing code structure.

## Evolution of Project Decisions & Workflow

-   **Memory Bank First**: Established the practice of creating/updating Memory Bank core files at the beginning of a work session or significant task.
-   **Structured Workflow**: Adopted a clear workflow: define requirements -> understand architecture & tech -> implement -> test -> commit.
-   **Testing and Commits**: User emphasized the requirement for thorough testing of each feature and committing changes upon success. This is now part of the documented workflow in `activeContext.md` and `techContext.md`.
-   **Adaptability to Information Sources**: Shifted from relying on local large files (which failed to load) to attempting to use SwaggerHub URLs for API documentation. Due to browser interaction limitations, now requesting raw API spec content directly from the user. Using direct content for architectural overview (`repomix-output.xml`) was successful.
